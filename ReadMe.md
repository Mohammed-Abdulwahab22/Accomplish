**2. Using HTML Classes with CSS:**

For more control over image size and styling, you can leverage HTML classes and CSS within your README. Here's how:

**a. Create a CSS Class (Optional):**

If you want to reuse the same styling for multiple images, you can define a CSS class in your README:

```markdown
<style>
  .custom-image-size {
    max-width: 400px;
    /* Add other styling properties as needed (e.g., margin, padding) */
  }
</style>
